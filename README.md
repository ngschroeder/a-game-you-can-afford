# A Game You Can Afford In This Economy

## Making the project public
I've shared the source code of this game for educational purposes. It's been (rougly) updated from Godot 3.x to version 4. While you can build and play it using Godot 4, be aware that it's not performance-optimized for this version, and there might be undiscovered bugs.

This game holds a special place for me as it was my first complete software project. Keep in mind that I was learning the ropes in Godot, so the code reflects my learning curve. There are areas where I didn't adhere to best practices, to put it kindly. But hey, it's a finished project, right? :laughing: For security reasons, I've cleared the repo history due to some cloud resource names that were previously checked in.

For those interested in the original and stable version built on Godot 3.x, it's available on Steam and itch.io.

## Some more technical details
UPDATE: I have (very roughly) ported the game from Godot 3 to 4. It runs. There are bugs, but mostly they just make things a little uglier. I had to strip out the various larger screen resolutions because they were broken horribly due to a lot of breaking changes related to display handling, and I don't feel like fixing them. I stripped out the telemetry stuff.

<strike>The game is written in Godot 3.x. I am the sole collaborator. I implemented telemetry just to proof out the concept. Telemetry data consists of only a few things:
 - random player GUID created on first startup
 - where the user clicks within the game
 - anything typed into the secret text window

No additional information about the user (such as IP or other cookie/system info) is collected. Telemetry can be disabled in the Options menu.</strike>

## Description
You wake up in your squalid apartment. Your phone screen is horribly cracked, and the alarm won't shut off. You're so tired... you aren't even sure which job you're supposed to go to today.
Everything is getting more expensive. Unaffordably expensive. Groceries. Bills. How much more can you take? How can this even be sustainable?

Do you have what it takes to handle the struggle? Can you figure out a way to make it to a better life? To get out of this rut, and finally get your head above water? Enter the world of the protagonist, and find out if you can withstand the seemingly relentless hardship life is throwing at you. Or will you fall by the wayside - another chewed-up casualty of our unforgiving system? You can't control your luck, but your choices are all up to you...
