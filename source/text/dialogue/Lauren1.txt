Hey there, happy Vastmar-TASTIC day to you,
valued team member!
[/color]
------------------------------------------------
God I hate this.
------------------------------------------------
[color=lime][You:]
Hey Lauren.
[/color]
------------------------------------------------
[color=fuchsia][Lauren:]
I've got a big task for you today. Not sure if
you remember what the day after tomorrow is...?
[/color]
------------------------------------------------
I don't remember. I'm not even sure what day
today is. I don't answer.

------------------------------------------------
[color=fuchsia][Lauren:]
... it's our Fall Season SAVE-stravaganza!
[/color]
------------------------------------------------
Can't this fucking billion-dollar company just
let us do the work while keeping our own
identities and dignity intact?
------------------------------------------------
Do we really also have to be expected to role-
play like children while we're here? Using
branded vocabulary words delivered with over-
the-top fake enthusiasm?
------------------------------------------------
Does this really have to be part of my life?
------------------------------------------------
[color=lime][You:]
Oh yeah, right, the save-stravaganza...
[/color]
------------------------------------------------
My brain is on fire trying to figure out how to
try to sound like I care a little bit. Trying so
hard to not seem like I'm deadpan on purpose,
just to mock her.
------------------------------------------------
[color=lime][You:]
... cool.
[/color]
------------------------------------------------
*sigh*
------------------------------------------------
She's giving me kind of a disapproving look.
Probably because I'm not very excited about the
sale. I'm not trying to seem like I don't care,
I'm just not very good at pretending I care.
------------------------------------------------
Either way, my lack of enthusiasm is kind of a
direct assault on her fake enthusiasm. My
attitude is a reminder to her that she's being
fake, and it's making her uncomfortable.
------------------------------------------------
For just a brief moment, she seems annoyed. She
pulls out a scanner and thrusts it at me curtly.
------------------------------------------------
[color=fuchsia][Lauren:]
Here you go.
[/color]
------------------------------------------------
The corporate brainwashing kicks in again and
she perks back up.
------------------------------------------------
[color=fuchsia][Lauren:]
We just need you to scan and update as many
inventories as you can during your shift. You'll
be in kitchenwares and produce.

------------------------------------------------
CHOICES
OK, got it.
Can you explain my task in more detail?
I don't think I can do this...
Take this mindless bullshit and shove it!
