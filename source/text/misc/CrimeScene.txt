I can't go back in, it's a crime scene now.

I'll have to call the owner tomorrow to see if
the store will closing until the glass is fixed.

And to see if I'm fired.

------------------------------------------------
Seems like a shitty reason to fire someone,
right?

------------------------------------------------
But he would totally do it, depending on his
mood.
------------------------------------------------
It's possible he'll blame me, somehow, for what
happened. He'll imagine I could have done some-
thing differently.
------------------------------------------------
But you know what?

------------------------------------------------
To hell with him and that guy. I'm glad I didn't
give him a dollar.

------------------------------------------------
Don't get me wrong, dying over one single stupid
dollar would have been pretty stupid.
------------------------------------------------
But at the same time, it's kinda nice seeing an
asshole [b]NOT[/b] get what they want, for a change.
