I'm clean enough at the moment. I don't want to
waste any water if I can avoid it.
------------------------------------------------
My water has been turned off a couple of times
from not paying the bill. I had to get a payday
loan to get it turned back on the last time.
------------------------------------------------
Can't hold down a job without being able to wash
your ass once in awhile.
------------------------------------------------
Anyway, now I get a wave of anxiety every time
I turn on a faucet, second-guessing if I paid
the bill or not.
------------------------------------------------
So I'd rather leave it off.
