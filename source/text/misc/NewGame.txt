Ugh... this alarm ringtone...
------------------------------------------------


                   * SMACK *
------------------------------------------------


... my screen is cracked ...
------------------------------------------------


                   * SMACK *
------------------------------------------------


... so it takes a few tries to stop it.
------------------------------------------------


                   * SMACK *
------------------------------------------------


Finally.
------------------------------------------------
God this phone sucks. But who the hell has a
hundred dollars for a phone screen repair? Just
gotta wait it out until it's time for a new
phone. Still a year and a half away at least.
------------------------------------------------
To add insult to injury, it was already a shitty
phone before the screen broke.
------------------------------------------------
Funny how everyone who isn't rich is just one
broken phone away from having a shitty phone for
life.
------------------------------------------------
Had a pretty nice one once. Broke it. Didn't
have the insurance. Had to roll the balance on
the broken phone into the next one, so this one
had to be cheap.
------------------------------------------------
Cheap. Fucking thing was still $400.
------------------------------------------------
Now here I am, almost 2 years later, and I've
still got $500 left to pay on this basic, broke-
ass phone. Too bad I couldn't afford that
insurance...
------------------------------------------------
It's night out, so it's hard to wake up. My work
schedule is an erratic mess, too, so I'm always
tired.
------------------------------------------------
Plus I'm pretty sure I'm suffering from some
serious depression. Of course, I can't afford
any therapy or anything.
------------------------------------------------
As much as I hate it, I have to get up and get
going. The past-due bills piling up.
