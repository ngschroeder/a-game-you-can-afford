This place is huge, and yet somehow, it seems
even bigger once you're on the inside.

There are seas of cars, and every so often a
short steel arch on the groud that you can
chain your bike to.

I usually try to hurry up and get inside. It's
pretty dark, and the security cameras out here
aren't always reliable.
