You scan the bread maker, and a flood of
memories washes over you.

------------------------------------------------
My mom used to make fresh bread. She did it
all by hand, and hers was always so good.

------------------------------------------------
One year, someone got her a breadmaker as a
gift. It was one of these cheap Vastmart kind,
probably cost only a few dollars less than this
one, even with today's inflation.
------------------------------------------------
One weekend, she tried it out. She went into it
with an open mind. She followed the instructions
perfectly.
------------------------------------------------
The thing it produced was so nasty. On one side
it was something that looked like bread. The
other side was a soggy lump. We laughed a lot
that day.

These things are such pieces of shit.
