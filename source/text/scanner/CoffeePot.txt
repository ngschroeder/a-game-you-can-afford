You mindlessly scan the coffee pot,
punch in some numbers, and continue
thinking about your life.

I know I could be doing more - should be doing
more - I just don't know what to do. I feel like
I wasn't ready for all of the problems that hit
me just as I struck out on my own.
------------------------------------------------
The virus. My mom dying. All this inflation. My
life just kind of floated into its current state
due to a lot of external factors.
------------------------------------------------
Now I'm stuck in and endless, poverty-fueled
depression, and for the life of me, I can't find
the tools or the motivation to figure out a new
direction for my life.

Coffee pots. Cheap ones. A pack of coffee costs
just as much a the goddamn coffee pot now.

------------------------------------------------
Another simple pleasure the less well-off used
to be able to enjoy, gone.
