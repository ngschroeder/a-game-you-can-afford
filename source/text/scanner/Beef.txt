Nothing makes the pain of this economy more
obvious than the price of fresh food. Especially
meat or dairy.
------------------------------------------------
These prices are a full 30% more than just two
years ago.
------------------------------------------------
The virus really fucked everything up. Some days
I wonder if we'll ever get back to the way
things used to be.
------------------------------------------------
At least a few years ago I could afford to have
beef every great once in awhile. I would get the
scrap meat for $5, pound it thin, and add it to
my ramen. It was a nice boost of protein.
------------------------------------------------
I could stretch one pack out to last for a week.

------------------------------------------------
Now? Forget about it. With the price of the good
stuff up 30%, everybody wants the cheap stuff,
so the greedy fuckers have just marked it up.
------------------------------------------------
Stew beef? $10 now. 100% markup. Just because
of greed.
------------------------------------------------
This kind of shit should be criminal.
