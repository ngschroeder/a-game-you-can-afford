------------------------------------------------
Pork chops used to be another cheap meat I could
actually afford once in awhile. I'd put it in
my pork ramen to spruce it up.
------------------------------------------------
Now the price has skyrocketed. And with these
bone-in ones, you're paying top dollar for a
bunch of goddamned bones.
