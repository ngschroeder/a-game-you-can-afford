Six dollars for a pound of oranges is just nuts.

Fruits and vegetable are getting the one-two
punch of inflation, plus rising costs due to
lack of workers to harvest the crops.
------------------------------------------------
The anti-immigration people enacted a bunch of
policies that not only cut back on the illegal
immigration, they also made a bunch of changes
to the legal immigration process.

It's much harder for temporary farm workers to
get here, and they get paid less now, so no one
is coming.
------------------------------------------------
That's probably the intended outcome by the
people who engage in magical thinking, who
assumed native citizens would just fill the void
and do the work.
------------------------------------------------
Except they aren't taking the jobs. Even when
offered higher wages. So now an orange costs $3.

Smooth-brained legislators strike again.
