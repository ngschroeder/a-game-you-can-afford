I can't honestly fathom how this thing is still
only ten dollars. That has to be the cost of
the raw materials, at this point.
------------------------------------------------
Maybe they're keeping the price the same and
just taking the loss as a form of psychological
warfare on the general public... 
------------------------------------------------
Trying to keep the price of some things the same
so we think "See, things aren't that bad!"
------------------------------------------------
Maybe they hope - maybe they [i]know[/i] - stuff like
that can keep the sense of desperation just low
enough to stave off a mass panic.
------------------------------------------------
Or maybe this is one of those things that fell
through the cracks, and kind of serves as soft
evidence that the "inflation" is all just stores
jacking up prices out of pure greed.
------------------------------------------------
...

------------------------------------------------
Or maybe I'm just overthinking it, and it's just
a goddamn toaster.
