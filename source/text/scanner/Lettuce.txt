[b]Organic Bib Lettuce[/b]
$4.99[/color][/center]

------------------------------------------------
Five dollars for lettuce. Lettuce is a thing I
actually vividly remember the price of from when
I was a kid.
------------------------------------------------
On hot summer days when I was very young - 5 or
6 years old - my mom would give me a leaf of
lettuce with salt and pepper on it for a snack.
------------------------------------------------
I have no idea why, but I really loved it. So
when we went to the market, I would get the
lettuce. It cost one dollar.
------------------------------------------------
In two decades, the price has gone up 500%.

In two decades, minimum wage has gone up 23%.

Something seems wrong with this picture.
