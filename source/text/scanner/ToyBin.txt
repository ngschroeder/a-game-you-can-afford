There's probably enough lead and cadmium in this
bin to kill a small child. We know PVC is toxic,
and yet, it's still found in toys here.

just needs to pick up the phone and kill any
safety regulations that might stop them from
selling poisonous toys to children.

"Why would you want a secret cabal of big-
government bureaucrats telling you what you can
and can't buy? Why do they hate your freedom?"

Gotta love those types. Yes, thank you for
bestowing upon us the freedom to purchase toys
that will give children cancer. What would we
do without you?
