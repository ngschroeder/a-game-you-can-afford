A police officer approaches you.

------------------------------------------------
What the hell, I can't even sit in the goddamn
park for 15 minutes...
------------------------------------------------
[color=#D87093][Officer:]
Good evening.

------------------------------------------------
[color=lime][You:]
Hello officer.

------------------------------------------------
[color=#D87093][Officer:]
What brings you out to the park so late tonight?
[/color]
------------------------------------------------

You point to your nametag.

------------------------------------------------
[color=lime][You:]
Just got off work and needed to clear my head.
I live over on the east side, and the fumes were
really bothering me today.

------------------------------------------------
[color=#D87093][Officer:]
Yeah, the air gets pretty nasty over there.

She says some kind of code into the radio that's
buried under the hair on her left shoulder. She
must have called in before confronting you.
------------------------------------------------
[color=#D87093][Officer:]
Sir, unfortunately the park is closed after
10 P.M., so it would be best if you move along
and head indoors for the night.

Her demeanor is very neutral.
She awaits your response.
