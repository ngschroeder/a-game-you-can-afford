When my mom died, I thought I could take some
time working entry-level jobs until I figured
out what I wanted to do with my life.
------------------------------------------------
The months turned into years, and now I feel
like I'm just stuck in this ... caste. A service
worker caste, where I'm perpetually stuck by the
self-sustaining nature of poverty.
------------------------------------------------
But you look at the news, and it's like no one
has a reason to be unhappy about this system.
You'd think everything is great, if you didn't
know better.
------------------------------------------------
Regardless of which side wins an election,
theyimmediately start talking about how great
they're making the economy.
------------------------------------------------
"Job numbers are up. Unemployment is down.
The stock market is up."
------------------------------------------------
Yet no one gets raises. Minimum wage stays low,
while the price of everything goes up. Anybody
can take one look outside a thriving suburb, and
see that suffering and poverty are everywhere.
------------------------------------------------
Is a permanent underclass of terminally poor
people just a component of what these people
consider a "great economy"?
------------------------------------------------
If that's the case, they should probably just be
honest about that when you're a kid.
------------------------------------------------
"Sorry Timmy, your parents only make $9 an hour,
so you can't afford to purchase the books and
the classes you need to become a doctor."
------------------------------------------------
"And even if you could, you'd never have the
time, because as soon as you're old enough to
work, you need to drop school to work full time,
because the price of everything has gone up and
your parent have past due bills now."
------------------------------------------------
"Thank you for your sacrifice, we need to keep
that economy roaring!"

What a fucking joke.
