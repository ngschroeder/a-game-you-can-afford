When you look at this wall, you're
overwhelmed with disgust.

------------------------------------------------
This landlord is so goddamned lazy.

------------------------------------------------
Whoever lived here before had a dresser or some-
thing there, and spilled some kind of nasty-ass
liquid all down the of back it. Then they never
cleaned it up, because of course they didn't.
------------------------------------------------
The landlord couldn't even be bothered to paint
over it, so now I just have to look at it.
------------------------------------------------
I try not to think about it, but every time I
let my mind wander I start to guess at what the
spill might have been.
------------------------------------------------
I always go back to marinara sauce - like it was
a giant bowl of spaghetti or something.
------------------------------------------------
So basically every waking moment I'm in this
apartment, I think I smell rotting spaghetti.
