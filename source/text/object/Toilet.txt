The place where all the magic happens.
------------------------------------------------
And by "magic", I mean urine and feces.
------------------------------------------------
And sometimes vomit.

It always smells a bit like sewage in here. I
assume this is the cheapest toilet money can
buy, attached to the cheapest pipes, which lead
back to the cheapest septic system.
