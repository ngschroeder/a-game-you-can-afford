This is my bike. I've had it for a few years
now.
------------------------------------------------
My last bike got stolen, so now I've got a very
crappy one.
------------------------------------------------
It's just good enough to get me around, but bad
enough that no one has bothered to try and steal
it. Yet.
------------------------------------------------
I put a lock on it anyway. This is the only way
I can get anywhere. Ride share apps cost too
much, and the bus system in this city is a total
disaster.
------------------------------------------------
If anything happened to it, I'd be completely
screwed.
