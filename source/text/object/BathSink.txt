This is where I wash up. This sink basically
serves as my shower and my washing machine.
------------------------------------------------
I have a shower hose for the faucet, but it's a
hassle. Even though there's a drain on the
floor, it still makes a mess because it's cheap
and leaky. I only use it once a week.
------------------------------------------------
Plus a shower wastes a lot more water, and water
isn't cheap. Not anymore.
