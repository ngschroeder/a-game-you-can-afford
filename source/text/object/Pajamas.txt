These are my home clothes - my last sweatsuit
that isn't totally riddled with holes.

------------------------------------------------
They're starting to smell, I need to wash them
soon. I've just been doing my laundry in the
sink in my bathroom.

------------------------------------------------
The machines are in the building next door, and
I don't feel like going over there. Plus the
price is up to $3 per wash and $3 per dry.

------------------------------------------------
Highway fucking robbery. Like everything else.
