A microwave. The cheapest microwave you can get.
$19.99 at Vastmart.
------------------------------------------------
Pretty hilarious. Most of what little money I
have, I earn working at Vastmart.
------------------------------------------------
Then I turn right around and spend a big chunk
of my paycheck at Vastmart.
------------------------------------------------
When I can afford food, I get it at work after
my shift. Whatever I need, I just get it there.
I'm broke, I'm already there, and all their shit
is really cheap.
------------------------------------------------
Not only do they save money by not giving me
full-time hours so they don't have to offer
benefits, they [i]profit[/i] from keeping me unable to
afford other options.
------------------------------------------------
I don't have any health insurance, but the walk-
in at Vastmart is only $20. I don't have a
vision plan, but eye exams are only $15 at
Vastmart.
------------------------------------------------
Pretty fucking amazing self-sustaining fiefdom
they have going there.
------------------------------------------------
I'd quit my job on priciple if I thought I could
tolerate living under a bridge.
------------------------------------------------
I half-jokingly suspect at some point Vastmart
will have a booth where their employees can just
euthanize themselves for $9.99, and have their
ashes packaged into fertilizer for the Gardening
Center.
------------------------------------------------
Anyway, this is my microwave. It heats food.
