You look over the inventory racks.

Well, here it is. An endless sea of shit.
------------------------------------------------
You might have read on the internet that when we
say "we don't have any more in the back", it's
true, because we don't keep inventory. But a lot
of times, that's a lie.
------------------------------------------------
We could have it in the back, depending on what
"it" is. I mean, if there was nothing back here,
what's all this stuff doing here?
------------------------------------------------
We'll usually just say we don't have it because
we're already in the middle of some task, and
this job requires us to basically be automatons,
operating on our pre-programmed schedules.
------------------------------------------------
It's true we don't keep a lot of big, expensive
stuff back here, like TVs and gaming consoles.
------------------------------------------------
But if your favorite deodorant or cereal wasn't
on the shelf, chances are we probably did have
it in the back.
------------------------------------------------
Sorry about that.
