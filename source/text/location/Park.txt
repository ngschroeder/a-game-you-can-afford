The park is empty and still. The leaves rustle
ever-so-slightly, but it's otherwise very quiet.
The weather is cool but pleasant.

When I have time in between shifts and the
weather is good, sometimes I come here to sit
and think and breathe some fresh air, away from
the factories.

I grew up on this side of town, and the park
always reminds me of my childhood.
------------------------------------------------
I used to sit here on these very same benches
with my best friend as a teenager, and we would
dream of leaving this town - going off on our
own adventures and becoming successful.

Now my friend is almost a doctor, and I'm here
doing who-knows-what with my life. We rarely
exchange texts to say hello anymore, and it's
usually just on our birthdays.
------------------------------------------------
I really need to get it together.
