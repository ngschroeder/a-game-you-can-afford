Throngs of people queue up to pay for their
items. The store is quite busy.

------------------------------------------------
It's pretty early in the evening, so the store
is still slammed. As bad as this is, it's only
going to get worse the closer it gets to the
holidays.
------------------------------------------------
Never any shortage of people needing to buy lots
of cheap shit.
------------------------------------------------
Not that I'm one to talk. I buy everything here
too.
------------------------------------------------
I should make my way to the back room and check
in with the shift supervisor.
