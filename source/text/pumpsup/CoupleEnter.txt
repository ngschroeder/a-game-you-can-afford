A couple enters the store.

I feel a wave of anxiety when new customers
come in. You'd think I'd be used to it by now,
but I'm not.
------------------------------------------------
Especially if I can tell the they're doing well
financially. I think because I'm in the exact
opposite situation, I can't help but feel...
inferior.
------------------------------------------------
I know I shouldn't. I know I'm [b]not[/b] inferior.
But a lifetime of societal conditioning is
screaming in my brain, telling me otherwise.
------------------------------------------------
It sucks.
