You open the safe. There's such a small amount
of money inside, no one even bothers locking it.

------------------------------------------------
We keep one roll of each kind of coin, and an
envelope with some small bills.
------------------------------------------------
As insignificant as the sum is, even this tiny
amount of money would give me breathing room for
at least a few months.
------------------------------------------------
I often think about whether or not I could get
back into learning IT. Maybe get a simple tech
support job.
------------------------------------------------
I really want - NEED - more money. Like, pretty
desperately. But, do I want to become just
another human interface between rich business
owners and their computers?
------------------------------------------------
I feel like most of these jobs - and all this
technology - are turning me and everyone else
more and more into machines ourselves. 
------------------------------------------------
My mom used to talk about how everything has
changed since the internet and cell phones came
along.
------------------------------------------------
We barely have a sense of community anymore. The
libraries are getting emptier. Books, clubs, and
other groups for hobbies and recreation are all
online now.
------------------------------------------------
Everything is online, and it feels so.

------------------------------------------------
Everything is online, and it feels so..

------------------------------------------------
Everything is online, and it feels so...

------------------------------------------------
... impersonal.

------------------------------------------------
Like no one even wants to bother talking to new
people. Making friends - or even acquaintences -
is something we avoid now. People move houses
all the time, and we barely have relationships
with our neighbors.
------------------------------------------------
Truth be told, some days I miss having a working
phone more than I miss my old friends. Why? Is
the escape of the internet really better than
human friendship?
------------------------------------------------
Probably not.

------------------------------------------------
What are we becoming? I'm afraid if I go into a
life of IT, I'll just get more and more isolated
from the real world.
------------------------------------------------
But still... I am so tired of my crumbling,
musty apartment. Of being hungry. Of having my
lights turned off.
------------------------------------------------
I just want some stability. Just a little bit...

------------------------------------------------

You get more lost in your thoughts as you think
about the safe and the money inside...
