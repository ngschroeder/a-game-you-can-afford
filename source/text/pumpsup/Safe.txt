This is the safe, the thing armed robbers are
always after.
------------------------------------------------
There are signs everywhere saying there's less
than a hundred dollars in the safe, and that's
usually true.
------------------------------------------------
Virtually nobody pays with cash anymore, and if
we run out of change, I have a sign I put on the
door that says "Credit/Debit Only".
------------------------------------------------
But, reading has never been the strong suit of
armed robbers, so they try anyway.
------------------------------------------------
Thankfully I've never been here for one. The
last time was a few months before I started,
during the day shift.
------------------------------------------------
I worry about it though, especially being here
alone overnight, so close to the highway.
------------------------------------------------
It feels like it's only a matter of time.
